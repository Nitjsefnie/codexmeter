'''Archive Codex CLI rollouts to R2. Third sibling of the Claude and Kimi
archivers (~/.claude/scripts/archive_sessions.py,
~/.kimi-code/scripts/archive_sessions.py), and deliberately not a new design:
the key layout, the compression policy, the per-machine manifest, the
single-instance lock and the retention gate are all theirs.

Designed to run hourly via cron. Behaviour per run:
1. Acquire single-instance lock (fcntl, Windows msvcrt fallback). If a
   previous run still holds it, exit silently.
2. For every rollout under ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/, read its
   session_meta head, derive its key, upload (size-skip, idempotent).
3. Publish one sessions/<hash>/project.json marker per project so the
   dashboard can show a path instead of a hash.
4. Delete a local rollout once it is uploaded AND older than DAYS.
5. Log a one-liner summary to ~/.codex/archive-codex-sessions.log.

WHY THE KEY LAYOUT IS THE KIMI ONE, NOT A CODEX-SHAPED ONE
----------------------------------------------------------
On disk Codex is date-bucketed (YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl) and
carries no project in the path at all. That layout cannot be uploaded
as-is: backend/ingest.py reads project_id and session_id OUT OF THE KEY,
before it fetches anything. So the archiver does the translation, exactly
as the Kimi one already does for kimi-code (mapping agents/main/wire.jsonl
onto sessions/<hash>/<uuid>/wire.jsonl):

  sessions/<md5(cwd)[:12]>/<thread_id>/wire.jsonl[.xz]
  sessions/<md5(cwd)[:12]>/<thread_id>/subagents/<rollout_uuid>/wire.jsonl[.xz]
  sessions/<md5(cwd)[:12]>/project.json                       {"path": cwd}

Both facts that shape it were measured over the 51 rollouts on this box:

  * A MAIN thread has exactly one rollout file (9 files, 9 thread ids), so
    <thread_id> is a unique key for it.
  * A SUBAGENT thread REUSES its parent's session_id — 42 subagent files
    share just 2 thread ids — so those must be keyed per file, by the uuid
    in the filename. That is why they take the subagents/ leg, which also
    gives ingest the is_main split it already looks for.

Grouping a whole fork family under one <thread_id> is the point, not a
side effect: usage_rollup is keyed by session_id, and those files are one
logical session.

Flags:
  --days N    retention threshold for the delete gate (default 3)
  --dry-run   preview every action; no R2 puts, no local removals

Exit code: 0 on success, 1 if any upload failed.
